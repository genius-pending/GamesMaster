# GamesMaster
A website created in homage to the tv show and magazine of the 90s called GamesMaster, So I finally got around to starting this project 
I created this repo back in april 2021 and havnt touched it since now as I have been doing a lot of coding in my full time job as a data analyst working mostley on back end servers. I have missed working on the front end so found the motivation to pick this back up. 
My intial commit contains basics features such as a search bar and a homepage with a pop-up modal. I will be working on the API call to generate cards with information on computer games.
